# Earth Engine Tasks

An extension for monitoring Earth Engine tasks. 

## Features

Use the "EE Tasks: open panel" to open a vscode panel. It will show a table of your EE tasks (ID, description, etc.).

A default maximum number of tasks to request is set to 100, which can be modified in the user options.

## Requirements

This extension does not offer a method to [authenticate to earth engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/auth). Instead, it relies on either stored credentials by the [earthengine command line tool](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/command_line) or a token generated by [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/print-access-token). By default, the `earthengine-cli` credentials are used. Therefore, the minimum requirement is to have the earthengine cli installed and authenticated with an earth engine account. 

## Extension Settings


This extension contributes the following settings:

* `eetasks.limit`: Maximum number of tasks to request from earthengine. This value is set by default to null, which means that there is no limit to the number of tasks to retrieve. 

* `eetasks.authMethod`: Method to authenticate to Earth Engine: either "earthengine-cli" (default) or "gcloud".
